# Geode-for-iOS-GD
This is guide that will help learn you how to install Geode on iOS since it is only for android or windows or Mac.
Step 1. To get started, you'll need:
A PC running Windows 10 or later
An Apple ID
An Internet connection
An iPhone or iPad with iOS 14 or iPadOS 14 or later
On your computer, download every thing on the releases.
Extract the downloaded AltInstaller zip file and run setup.exe to install AltServer. You'll need to have the non-Microsoft Store version of iTunes and iCloud installed. Uninstall the Microsoft Store versions if you have either installed.
Step 2:Follow these steps to install SideStore:
Plug your device into your computer via a cable.
Trust your computer on your device (if prompted).
Launch Altserver and, holding shift, click on the AltServer tray icon and select Sideload .ipa.
Select the SideStore .ipa, follow instructions as prompted, and wait until AltServer confirms that SideStore has been installed.
Open Settings > General > VPN & Device Management on your device and approve of the Developer App linked to your Apple ID's email.
If your device is running iOS/iPadOS 16 or higher, you must now enable Developer Mode. To do that:
Open the Settings app
Tap “Privacy & Security”
Scroll to the bottom and toggle Developer Mode on
 Step 3: Follow these steps to Pair your device:
Extract Jitterbugpair.zip. Set a passcode for your device if you don't already have one and ensure that your device is still connected to your computer via cable.
Open your device to its homescreen. Then, in File Explorer, locate jitterbugpair.exe and execute it by double-clicking it or right-clicking it and selecting open.
JitterBugPair will then generate a pairing file within the same folder. This pairing file will have the file exentension mobiledevicepairing. If no file generates, try running JitterBugPair as an administrator or follow steps 5-7 listed here.
Zip this pairing file and transfer it to your device via Google Drive, emailing it to yourself, or any other method.

In the Files app, longpress on your zipped pairing file and select uncompress. Then, locate and launch the SideStore app and select OK when prompted.
If you cannot find the SideStore app you may need to restart your device to make it appear.
Select your now unzipped pairing file and SideStore will be paired!
Note that if you update your iDevice your pairing file will become invalid and you'll have to go through this process again.
To get SideStore to prompt you for your pairing file again tap Reset Pairing File in the SideStore app.
Step 4: On your device, download the StosVPN app. Then, Enable the StosVPN VPN. You'll have to enable this VPN whenever you wish to use SideStore. StosVPN does not connect to an external server, but rather allows your device to communicate with itself.
If left enabled, SideStore will attempt to refresh your sideloaded apps in the background when necessary.
Step 5: Now to finish the process:
Open SideStore and sign in with the same Apple ID you used to install SideStore.
Go to the Apps tab and refresh the SideStore app by tapping on the green day counter or selecting Refresh All. You must do this whenever you install SideStore. Doing otherwise might cause errors, including SideStore expiring earlier than it should.

Now you're all set! You can use the sources menu to add installable apps to the browse tab or directly sideload any .ipa files on your device with the + icon in the Apps tab.
Note that if you ever let an app expire you won't be able to access it until you refresh it again. To refresh SideStore, simply follow the steps you followed to install it. (Do not uninstall the SideStore app while doing this.) Altserver will refresh Sidestore and it will continue to function. For any other app, just refresh it normally, and it will work again.
Then sideload stikjit and geode and in the stikjit app enable jit in geode.
